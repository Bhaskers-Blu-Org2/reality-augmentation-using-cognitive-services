# Overview

Augmented reality is hot. Artificial intelligence is hot. Combining the two to create an augmented view of reality where pictures can be identified, tracked, and labeled with meaningful text is a truly fun and exciting experience. This page describes how to use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta) and [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to create a desktop application to do just that. The application can be run as-is on the desktop emulator, and it can also be deployed onto the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

The application uses the [Microsoft Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/), part of Microsoft Cognitive Services, to extract meaningful text from images. [Vuforia](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/Object-Recognition) is used for image detection and tracking. [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) is used to create script actions that call out to the Computer Vision API and also to deploy the application to the HoloLens.

The below steps describe how to create two demos. The first demo shows how to recognize and track an image, and draw a cube on top of it. The second demo builds upon the first demo by showing how to extract meaningful text about a recognized image from the Computer Vision API and superimpose it on top of your view.

So, feel free to follow the steps below to get started  - and have fun!

# Demo Four - Camera

This demo shows how to recognize and track an image, and draw a cube on top of it. When running, it looks like this:

## Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to deploy the application when using the emulator:

1. Clone this repo (or download as zip and extract) into a local repo directory. Example:
   - choose a local repo directory, which we'll refer to as `<local-repo-dir>`, such as **c:\repos**
   - type **mkdir `<local-repo-dir>`**
   - type **cd `<local-repo-dir>`**
   - type **git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/reality-augmentation-using-cognitive-services**
1. Install Unity Editor
